Disable Template Editor [EE1]
===

This extension for **ExpressioneEngine 1.6.x (EE1)** gives you the ability to =Disable Template Management= in the control panel.

This extension is ported over from the [Disable-Template-Editor](https://github.com/bunchjesse/Disable-Template-Editor) for EE2 by [bunchjesse](https://github.com/bunchjesse).

What it does
---
* Disables the ability to create/modify/delete template groups
* Template editor becomes *read-only* to allow code viewing but prevents editing
* Hides the template revision list (if in source control, this becomes redundant entirely)
* Hides form actions/notes in the template editor

Installation
---
Move the file `ext.disable_template_editor.php` to the `system/extensions` directory and enable through the control panel. Simples.
